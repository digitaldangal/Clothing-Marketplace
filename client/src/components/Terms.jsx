                            SSENSE is only limited to high end and already establish clothing brands like Gucci and Versace. We provide a home for new brands to be able to establish themselves. 
                            Grailed is limited to reselling article of clothing from brands that are commonly listed on websites like SSENSE and Barneys. Grailed wasn't really made for people to sell clothing that they created.
